# Object-Detection-and-Real-Time-Tracking-CV

The algorithm we present allows users to track objects in real-time by either uploading a video or accessing their computer camera and manually selecting the object of interest. The movements of the object are then monitored, providing precise and valuable information with numerous applications, from security and surveillance to robotics and beyond. Our user-friendly interface makes object tracking accessible to a wide range of individuals and industries, making it a valuable tool for both seasoned computer vision professionals and those just starting out in the field.

### Built With
- Data Collection & Manipulation: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- Dynamic Object Tracking: [OpenCV](https://opencv.org)


## Features
The code implemented demonstrates the ease of using object tracking in computer vision and highlights its versatility as a tool. Some of the features include limitless boundary boxes to track and manual selection of the objects of interest. The center coordinates of each object tracked is calculated and collected in a dataframe which is locally saved on your computer at the end of the recording. Finally, you can use the article to monitor shapes from a pre-recorder video or even live stream! As computer vision continues to advance, we can expect to see more innovative and impactful uses for object tracking in the future.
